# Roller Rink
Roller rink is a theme that focuses on deep purples that contrast with a lot of bright colors. Perfect for late night coding. Inspired by [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) by Robb Owen.

I tested on a few languages like Python, JS, C, C++, Json, and Markdown.This is my first theme so if you notice any issues or missing colors please open an issue on GitHub!
